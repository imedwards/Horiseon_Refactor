# Horiseon_Refactor_Ticket

## Description
 
Horiseon Social Solution Services approached me with help making their websites code meet 
accessibility standards by adding HTML semantics in their code and adding alt attributes into their images and icons.

Upon initial inspection of the source code I found everything was coded with the "div" element and not much else which was the main source of the lack of accessiblity. The implementation of proper semantic and establishing proper code flow is a huge take away from this ticket that I will be taking into future projects and tickets.

The alt attributes were a little tricky as I didn't want to get too wordy but be more specific than descriptive. I did the same for the icons in the aside panel as well and did some sprucing up of the code by taking care of the footer size and giving the page an appropriate title.
